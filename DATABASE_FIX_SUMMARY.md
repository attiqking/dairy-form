# Database Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was showing a fatal error:
```
Fatal error: Uncaught PDOException: SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'aa.end_date' in 'where clause'
```

## Root Cause
1. The `animal_assignments` table existed but had different column names than expected by the code
2. The existing table had `assignment_date` but code expected `start_date` and `end_date`
3. The `health_records` table queries were using incorrect column names

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed animal_assignments table structure
- Added `start_date` column (copied data from existing `assignment_date`)
- Added `end_date` column (allowing NULL values for active assignments)
- Added `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamp columns
- Added proper indexes for performance
- Removed the old `assignment_date` column

### 2. Fixed health_records queries
- Changed `h.date` to `h.record_date as date`
- Changed `h.next_followup` to `h.next_action_date`

### 3. Updated SQL schema files
- Added the proper `animal_assignments` table definition to both SQL files
- Included proper foreign key constraints and indexes

## Files Modified
- `DairyFarm.sql` - Added animal_assignments table definition
- `DairyFarm/DairyFarm.sql` - Added animal_assignments table definition  
- `user/dashboard.php` - Fixed health records query column names
- Database tables updated via migration

## Current Status
✅ The dashboard should now work correctly without errors
✅ Animal assignments are properly tracked with start/end dates
✅ Health alerts query uses correct column names
✅ Sample data has been created for testing

## Testing
The fix has been tested with sample queries and confirmed to work correctly.
