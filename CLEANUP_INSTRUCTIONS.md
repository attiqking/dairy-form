# Manual Cleanup Instructions

The automated cleanup was mostly successful, but two folders (`auth` and `includes`) are still present because they're locked by a running process.

## To complete the cleanup manually:

1. **Close VS Code completely**
2. **Stop any running PHP/Apache processes** (if you have XAMPP running, stop it)
3. **Run this command in PowerShell**:
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force auth, includes
   ```

## Current Project Structure (after cleanup):

```
deepseek_dairy/
├── .vscode/           # VS Code settings (keep)
├── .gitignore         # Git ignore rules (updated for frontend)
├── cleanup.bat        # Cleanup script (can be deleted)
├── DairyFarm.js       # Frontend JavaScript functionality
├── index.html         # Main frontend file
├── package.json       # Node.js package configuration
├── README.md          # Database & API documentation
└── [auth/]            # ← DELETE MANUALLY
└── [includes/]        # ← DELETE MANUALLY
```

## Next Steps:

1. **Delete the remaining folders** (`auth` and `includes`)
2. **Delete `cleanup.bat`** (no longer needed)
3. **Install frontend development tools** (optional):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start development server** (optional):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Or simply open `index.html` in your browser

## Your clean frontend project now contains:
- ✅ **Frontend HTML file** (`index.html`)
- ✅ **Frontend JavaScript** (`DairyFarm.js`)
- ✅ **Database schema & API documentation** (`README.md`)
- ✅ **Development configuration** (`package.json`, `.gitignore`)
- ✅ **VS Code settings** (`.vscode/`)

The project is now ready for frontend development!
